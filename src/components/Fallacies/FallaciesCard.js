            talked about in class.

              In a world where the <strong>Fallacy of Composition</strong> runs
              rampant, some individuals believe that if each member of a team
              excels in their tasks, the entire team must undoubtedly be
              extraordinary. On the contrary, others succumb to the{" "}
              <strong>Fallacy of Division</strong>, assuming that the brilliance
              of a whole entity extends uniformly to its individual parts â€” as
              if every cog in a machine inherits the same level of
              sophistication as the machine itself. Meanwhile, the unwary often
              find themselves entangled in the intricate web of the{" "}
              <strong>Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy</strong>, meticulously
              selecting data points that conveniently support their claims
              without considering the broader picture. This tendency is akin to
              an erratic marksman who paints a target around clusters of bullet
              holes after the fact. As discussions unfold, it's not uncommon to
              witness the <strong>Fallacy Fallacy</strong>, where individuals
              hastily dismiss arguments solely because they identify a logical
              fallacy within, oblivious to the possibility that the conclusion
              might still hold merit despite the flawed reasoning.
